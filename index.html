		<h2>Aspiring Software Engineer</h2>
		<p>In the fall of 2015, a friend of mine and I were having a conversation after a pick-up basketball game. We weren't talking about anything in particular, just shooting the breeze, as friends do. 
		The conversation took a momentous turn, though, when my friend and I began discussing our respective coursework. This was a subject we had avoided for about a year because we (wrongly) assumed our 
		educational interests to be too disparate (he was a CS undergraduate student and I was an English graduate student at the time). It wasn't until my friend and I started to talk regularly about his 
		computing projects that I realized how closely the process of software development mirrors that of writing: planning and analyzing = researching, designing = outlining, implementing = writing, and 
		testing = editing. Most suprisingly, I discovered that the implementation part of software development, specifically coding, allows for an enormous amount of creativity. Being a playful and highly
		creative but rule abhoring kid through much of grade school (I used to throw away the instructions for Lego sets and build whatever came to mind), I avoided the prescriptive and law-based sciences,
		such as physics and chemistry, as much as possible in college because they imposed too much structure and didn't involve creativity. I didn't hate science; science intrigued me, but practicing lower-level
		physics and chemistry was so mind-numbingly mechanisitic: there is no creativity in introductory scientific experimentation. Thus, I delved into the humanitites as quickly and deeply as possible—even
		though I've always been enamoured with technology. It wasn't until my friend revealed to me that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of ways to write one block of code that I realized I had (almost) missed 
		my calling. After discovering my interest in coding, I signed up for an Intro to OOP course to learn more about programming. On only the third programming assignment I realized that I had 
		unknowingly taken the red pill, and—as with Neo in <i>The Matrix</i>—I was about to find out just how deep the rabbit hole goes. I am still in Wonderland, so to speak, as I continue to immerse myself in as
		many programming courses as I can afford. And, yet to quench my software development thirst, I am applying to UNF's MSwE program in the fall. In five years, I expect to be a full-time software engineer or 
		a software engineering doctoral student. Utlimately, I would like to be a software development business analyst or project manager. My specific computing interests, and potential areas of study in the future,
		are AI (who isn't interested in AI?), natural language processing, and UX. My AI interests and NLP interests intersect in computational linguistics, as I would like to learn more about our ability
		to "teach" machines how to process human languages. As for UX, I am cheifly interested in researching the extent to which understanding the interplay of culture, technology, and consciousness can be a 
		pathway to creating better UX.

		<h3>Part-Time English Faculty</h3>
		<p>Throughout my English masters program at UNF, I worked with the UNF English department and the UNF Writing Center as a graduate assistant. Upon completing the program, I assumed the role of instructor in the classroom. Assisting with and teaching writing classes has revealed to me how much I enjoy sharing my passion for a subject with others, and I look forward to my next opportunity to do so.<br>
